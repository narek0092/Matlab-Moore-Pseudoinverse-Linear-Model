# Matlab-Moore-Pseudoinverse-Linear-Model

Penrose file contains the code for solving and graphing the solution of a system equations by Moore´s Pseudoinverse.  

The control file contains the main code that analyses the variation of the linear model. Dealing with the degradation of linear models by means of successive updates. Matlab computer software is used to perform our experiments under different conditions for finding out model changes. 

The fun file contains a function created by myself for checking if the models vary due to this function.

The MECÁNICA 2018Diciembre_72331569L file is my final degree project.

-----------------------------------------
This code was developed by me in order to use it in my final degree project.
